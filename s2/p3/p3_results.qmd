I ran a quick pilot with N = `r nrow(data)` people on prolific. People seemed to understand the survey, and took a median time of `r mean_duration` minutes to complete the survey. We found that:Â 

### Compared to before, people now report the same level of self-control across conditions.

These domains seem to have less social desirability compared to punctuality and drinking from before.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5
knitr::include_graphics("figures/mean_sc_across_conditions.png")
```

### We still replicate our reference bias findings, with some heterogeneity.

Exemplars negatively predict self ratings of self control for bedtime, and healthy eating, less so for savings, and not for work hours. In bedtime and healthy eating, exemplars are more important than friends by a lot, for saving, they are the same, and for work hours, friends are more important.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 15
knitr::include_graphics("output/table1.png")
```

### Exemplars predict standars, and more so than friends...
Only for bedtime.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 5
knitr::include_graphics("figures/standards.png")
```

### Standards predict self ratings

```{r}
#| output: asis
data.z %>% 
  lm(sc_self ~ standard10 + self_minutes, data = .) %>% 
  stargazer::stargazer(type = "html")
```

### We can put it all together in a path model
And, like before it looks pretty consistent with what we hypothesized.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/paths.png")
```

There is however some heterogeneity; in this case the unconstrained model fits significantly better (*p* = `r constrain_p`). We are also underpowered to detect any difference between friends and role models either for standards or for behavior.

```{r}
multigroup_output
```

### Like before, results are not explainable by differences in difficulty of recall for friends and role models

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/plot_diffs.png")
```

There were differences between importance across domains
```{r}
#| warning: false
data %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_cl_normal(importance_self)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = y)) +
  geom_col()+
  geom_jitter(data = data, aes(y = importance_self), alpha = .2, width = .1)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),width = .2)+
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Reported Importance (0-10)")
```

### Results are not moderated by importance

```{r}
#| output: asis
datai = data |> group_by(condition) |> mutate_if(is.numeric,scale)
m1 = lm(sc_self ~ importance_self*exemplar_minutes + self_minutes, datai) 
m2 = lm(standard10 ~ importance_self*exemplar_minutes, datai)
m3 = lm(exemplar_minutes ~ importance_self, datai)
m4 = lm(friend_minutes ~ importance_self, datai)
stargazer::stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,type = "html")
```

looking at specific domains... 
```{r}
make_table = function(condition){
  datai = data |> filter(condition == condition) |> mutate_if(is.numeric,scale)
  m1 = lm(sc_self ~ importance_self*exemplar_minutes + self_minutes, datai) 
  m2 = lm(standard10 ~ importance_self*exemplar_minutes, datai)
  m3 = lm(exemplar_minutes ~ importance_self, datai)
  m4 = lm(friend_minutes ~ importance_self, datai)
  stargazer::stargazer(m1,m2,m3,m4,type = "html")
}
```
```{r}
#| output: asis
make_table("bedtime")
make_table("healthy eating")
make_table("saving")
make_table("work")
```
